# State of the game

at this point in development the we are just able to define the role of the player and the role of the computer.

### To-do

1. populate the Board class so the game is playable and it works as the rules intend
2. let codebreakers be able to make a guess, follow an algorithm if the codebreaker is the computer, ask for correct user input if the codebreaker is the player.
3. ~~let codemakers be able to create a sequence of numbers to use as the secret code, random if the codemaker is a computer, ask for correct user input if the codemaker is the player.~~
4. make it so the board exists, it can store a secret 4-digit code and it answers to the guesses in a way that corresponds to the rules.
